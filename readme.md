## Introduction

In the following capstone project, I decided to do an image classification task of different kinds of fruits using the [fruits-360](https://link) dataset, which provides 131! types of differents fruits, with some that may look pretty similar to the human eye, the dataset also presents the fruit images without any background , thus making it somewhat easier to train.


## Problem Description:
The problem: Fruits are often hard to classify manually given the wide variety of types, creating an automated classifier could help in the future, so that this task can be done instantly.
