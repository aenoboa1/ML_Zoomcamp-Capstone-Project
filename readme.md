## Introduction

In the following capstone project, I decided to do an image classification task of different kinds of fruits using the [fruits-360](https://link) dataset, which provides 131! types of differents fruits, with some that may look pretty similar to the human eye, the dataset also presents the fruit images without any background , thus making it somewhat easier to train.





## Problem Description:


The problem: Fruits are often hard to classify manually given the wide variety of types, it can be a really burdensome challenge due to the mass, creating an automated classifier could help in the future, so that this task can be done instantly.

### Fruit types to be classified

The dataset I choose for my project can be found <b>[here](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits) </b> you can download it using the kaggle website. Inside this dataset you can find tons of images containing different types of fruits, with the following structure

```.
├── ...
├── test                    # Test files (alternatively `spec` or `tests`)
│   ├── benchmarks          # Load and stress tests
│   ├── integration         # End-to-end, integration tests (alternatively `e2e`)
│   └── unit                # Unit tests
└── ...

```

 <b> NOTE :</b> Don't use the data inside `fruits-360-original-size`. This a new version that is not yet completed by the author.
