## Introduction

In the following capstone project, I decided to do an image classification task of different kinds of fruits using the [fruits-360](https://link) dataset, which provides <b> 131! </b> types of differents fruits, with some that may look pretty similar to the human eye, the dataset also presents the fruit images without any background , thus making it somewhat easier to train.





## Problem Description:


<b> The problem: </b> Fruits are often hard to classify manually given the wide variety of types, it can be a really burdensome challenge due to the mass, creating an automated classifier could help in the future, so that this task can be done instantly.

### Dataset- Fruits 360

The dataset I choose for my project can be found <b>[here](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits) </b> you can download it using the kaggle website, to reply the notebooks you should place it inside `data folder`. Inside this dataset you can find tons of images containing different types of fruits, with the following structure

```
.
├── data
│   ├── fruits-360
│   │   ├── papers # Paper of the dataset
│   │   ├── preview # folder I created to store the data augmentation previews
│   │   ├── Test # Test folder with 22688 images of 131 fruits 
│   │   ├── test-multiple_fruits # Contains images with multiple fruits. This is a good test for real-world detection.
│   │   └── Training  # Training folder with 67692 images of 131 fruits
│   └── fruits-360-original-size
```
**Filename format:** image_index_100.jpg (e.g. 32_100.jpg) or r_image_index_100.jpg (e.g. r_32_100.jpg) or r2_image_index_100.jpg or r3_image_index_100.jpg. "r" stands for rotated fruit. "r2" means that the fruit was rotated around the 3rd axis. "100" comes from image size (100x100 pixels).

 <b> NOTE :</b> Don't use the data inside `fruits-360-original-size`. This a new version that is not yet completed by the author.
